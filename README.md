# HumanFriendlyPasswordGenerator

A password generator strategy focused on creating highly secure, long passphrases that are designed to be **manually typeable** in high-friction environments (like mobile devices or RDP sessions).

This project is built on the philosophy that **Length > Complexity** and that a password's usability is critical to its real-world security.

##  philosophies

The best password is one stored in a **password manager**. This tool is not meant to replace them.

However, situations exist where a user **must** manually type a password:
* Initial login on a new device.
* Remote Desktop (RDP) or Terminal sessions.
* Mobile devices, where switching between number, letter, and symbol layouts is tedious.

### The Problem
Standard random passwords (e.g., `k!8(Gf%z#p@LqA`) are secure but **impossible to type** correctly. This high friction leads to two bad outcomes:

1.  **Errors:** Users get locked out after multiple failed attempts.
2.  **Insecurity:** Users abandon security and revert to the shortest, simplest password the system allows (e.g., `Summer2024!`), just to make it memorable.

A 20-character random string that must be verified character-by-character is **user-hostile**. A 30-character passphrase that can be verified **"chunk-by-chunk"** is user-friendly.

### The Solution
This generator creates long passphrases based on a 4-5 word list. The strategy makes them easy to type and verify, encouraging users to adopt much longer (and therefore more secure) passwords.

## 🔐 The Generation Strategy

This generator builds passwords using a "human-friendly" approach:

1.  **Base (Length):** It selects **4 to 5 random words**. This immediately creates a password of 25-35+ characters.
2.  **Formatting (Readability):** Words use `CamelCase` (`WordOneWordTwo`) to make them visually distinct.
3.  **Complexity (Rules):** A small block of **digits and one special character** is inserted between word pairs. This satisfies common "must have a number and symbol" password policies.
4.  **Chunking (Typing):** The resulting structure (e.g., `WordOne-123+WordTwo`) allows a user to type and verify in "chunks" (`WordOne`, `-123+`, `WordTwo`), which is significantly faster and less error-prone.
5.  **Entropie Boost (Optional):** The generator can be configured to introduce intentional misspellings or mix languages (e.g., German/English) to break standard dictionary attacks.

## 🛡️ Core Interoperability Rules

To guarantee a password can be typed on **any** system (Windows, Mac, Linux) with **any** keyboard layout (QWERTZ, QWERTY), this generator adheres to strict rules.

### 1. Character Set (Letters)
The wordlist **must exclude** words containing characters that change position on different keyboard layouts:

* **No `Z` or `Y`:** These are swapped on QWERTZ/QWERTY.
* **No Diacritics/Umlauts:** All words containing `ä`, `ö`, `ü`, `ß`, etc., are forbidden.

### 2. Special Characters (The "Universal Set")
Many special characters (`#`, `@`, `(`, `)`) are in different locations or require different key combinations ([Shift] vs. [AltGr]).

Therefore, only the following **four universally-positioned** special characters are used:

* `+` (Plus)
* `-` (Minus/Hyphen)
* `_` (Underscore)
* `!` (Exclamation Mark)

*(Note: We specifically exclude `=` as it often shares a key with `0` on non-US layouts, creating ambiguity).*

## Example Output

A password generated by this tool will look like this:

`HouseBoat-481+Coffee!99_Mountain`

This 33-character password is:
* **Secure:** Massively long.
* **Compliant:** Contains uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
* **Typeable:** Easy to enter on any device without layout confusion.
